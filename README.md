# 724-survey-analysis
I used "**Assumptions Necessary for Solid Self-Report Measurement to Work**" developed by Dr. Micheal Elasmar to analyze a survey designed by Apple. Those assumptions are showed below.

The objective is to find if the survey violated those assumptions and find ways to improve this survey. This is a class assignment for COM CM 724, Boston University.
