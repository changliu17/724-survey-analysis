# 724-survey-analysis
 I used "Assumptions Necessary for Solid Self-Report Measurement to Work" developed by Dr. Micheal Elasmar to analyze a survey designed by Apple. The objective is to find if the survey violated those assumptions and find ways to improve this survey. This is a class assignment for COM CM 724, Boston University.
